## Description
During my time as a Sys-Admin I've been repeatedly assinged with the task of collecting organizational data from endpoints, server and other IT systems. When possible I've always chosen to write an automated process to complete the job and no get off my chair. In this part I will explain a bit about each script.

In my case I've used platforms such as JumpCloud Directory and Active Directory WinRM. However these scripts can be used and and ajusted as templates for any enviroment that supports PowerShell.
